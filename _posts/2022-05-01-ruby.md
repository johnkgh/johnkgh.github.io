There is nothing notable about Ruby Mountain in the North Cascades, but its view of Ross Lake and the surrounding peaks is pretty cool.
We missed the powder window in favor of mashed potatoes so I definitely need to come back early on a cold bluebird day!

Ross Lake! I believe this used to be a forest that got cut down and flooded with water to form what you see today.

Jack Mountain is an absolute unit, 7500' above the lake

The road views in the North Cascades is so mediocre

## Notes
* This was probably ~13 miles and ~6300 feet of vertical gain.
