Eldorado Peak is one of the "Fifty Classic Ski Descents of North America" that shouldn't be.
The quality of skiing itself was mediocre but the views more than made up for it.
We were debating turning around with the grim visibility on the way up, but we pressed on and were instead rewarded with brief yet stunning views near the summit.

Oh I forgot about the 3000 feet of steep trails haha

## Notes
* This was probably ~11 miles and ~7000 feet of vertical gain.
