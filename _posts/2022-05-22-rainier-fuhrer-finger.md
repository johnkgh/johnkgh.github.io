Mount Rainier is just an absolute unit looming over the Seattle skyline from afar - a 14411' ruler from sea level if you were curious what that might look like.
I've always dreamed of what getting to the roof of Washington would be like after first seeing it.

Unfortunately, it turns out the views from the peak just aren't that good - definitely a mountain to awe at than look from the top of.
We skied off the summit down to Nisqually Bridge, an unforgettable 10500' continuous ski descent; where else can you keep your skis on for that long of a run?

I don't think I'm ever going to walk up a snowy mountain if I can't ski down it

All the way down into the bridge with weird conditions

## Notes
* This was probably ~16 miles and ~9700 feet of vertical gain.
