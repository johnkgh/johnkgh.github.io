Little Tahoma is a satellite peak of Rainier, the pointy thing next to the main summit.
I think it looks like a castle made of mahogany.
Little T is actually the remnants of what used to be an even bigger volcano; it's hard to imagine another a couple thousand feet on top of what Rainier is currently.

## Notes
