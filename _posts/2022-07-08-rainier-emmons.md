Just soaking in the views of the crevasses up close on this one.
I hung back with one of a friend who was having a problem with the altitude and encouraged the other two to summit without else since I had already been up this year.
A bit disappointing, but this outing confirmed my ability to make good decisions in practice, and was otherwise happy to explore this side of the mountain.

I can no longer remember how long we waited, but it was a _while_

## Notes
* This was probably ~11 miles and ~9800 of vertical gain, with a couple hundred feet of vert from walking up and down the while waiting for the others.
* This is probably where I learn it's nice to have multiple ropes depending on the group size so one person is not carrying all of the critical protection.
* We crushed the quick trail miles but faffing around really takes the wind out of the sails. Next time I do the Emmons I'll be admiring the sunrise while also moving.
