A glorified backpacking trip to round out skiing the Washington volcanos.
The ski descent was pretty mediocre, but it was otherwise cool to check out the changing season on Washington's most remote volcano.

## Notes
* This was probably ~35 miles and ~11000 feet of vertical gain over two days.
* Next time, go over the ridge of White Mountain as there will still be snow to ski down versus walking the summer trail.
