Dealing with a bit of funky weather on the long drive back home to WA.

Just nuking rain on the drive the night before, and also thundering hard which might be rare for California?

And back to the car.
Originally wanted to ski the NE, SE, and SW faces but there was probably about 3 inches of fresh snow that I was afraid would get manky very quickly.
Bit of corn pow skiing on the way back.
Also, probably the _weirdest_ deja vu moment I've ever had skiing back to the car, hard to describe.

## Notes
* This was probably ~6 miles and ~4000 feet of vertical gain.
