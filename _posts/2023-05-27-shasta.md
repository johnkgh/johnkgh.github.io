Big avy debris down the gulch, glad I'm not doing this line!

Looking down the west face.
In hindsight, I probably should have started _even_ later today with the clouds blocking the sun for corn.

## Notes
* This was probably ~12 miles and ~7200 feet of vertical gain.
* A fun day next time would be doing the Avalanche Gulch (Trinity Chutes) then linking up the west face.
