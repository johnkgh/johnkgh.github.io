I overstayed my summit and managed to get down with the resort all to myself in pretty slushy but fun conditions!

## Notes
* South Sister was probably ~11 miles and ~5000 feet of vertical gain and Mount Bachelor was probably ~4 miles and 2700 feet of vertical gain.
* South Sister was flat in two sections, the middle and summit. Not sure if there is a good way to avoid having to skin the middle flat.
* After doing some research, doing the Three Sisters Traverse doesn't seem that compelling. I feel like it'd be hard to time the aspects, getting the access/road timing would be funky, and South Sister wasn't particularly inspiring. I'd be compelled to do the Diller Headwall off the Middle then do something off the south side of North, since it seems kind of logical with the sun and the proximity between those two vs tacking on South.
