My third summit of hood and my second time skiing off the true summit.
I think I'm done with this route for good haha.

The usual view of Hood from Timberline.
I originally intended to ski the Meadows side but it was closed for construction the _one_ day I showed up.

Southern OR volcanos in the distance, nothing much around here

Views of the WA volcanos, man you can't even see Rainier without squinting very hard.
Barely any views to the north either.

One more looking south at the OR volcanos (Broken Top, Three Sisters, Jefferson)

Very booted out trail on spring snow, which made "skiing" off the summit pretty precarious

Onto the good stuff. The first turn is always the scariest!

## Notes
* This was probably ~7 miles and ~5400 feet of vertical gain.
