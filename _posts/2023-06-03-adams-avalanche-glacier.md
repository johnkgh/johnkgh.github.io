Feeling strong enough this season to go for a double lap on Mount Adams.

The best moon I have ever captured on a camera phone. I know Samsung fakes images of the moon when the camera detects one, but not sure about Apple.

Had to wait for corn o'clock. Nervous with an audience, but I was one of the earlier people to go down and more people definitely followed after watching me descend than with the skiers who I think started on too firm conditions. No pictures of the second lap because I had to crank the timing for the next corn cycle on the west aspect.

## Notes
* This was probably ~20 miles and ~11200 feet of vertical gain.
* I think it's hard to get perfect timing for both ski lines. I definitely started the SW Chutes on early but still fun corn (12:10 PM) and the west facing AG Headwall on perfect corn (2:40 PM). This makes 2:30 to get down the first line, transition, then skin 3600 feet of vert to the second, which seems reasonable if you're dialed. The skinning back up to the climbing route is not the easiest either since by then you're skinning on proper corn and therefore prone to slipping. I think I'd put ski crampons on next time.
