To add to the confusion, there is also a White Salmon Glacier on a prominent Washington mountain (Shuksan being the other).
I thought this terrain feature looked sooo cool on CalTopo but was unfortunately a bit more disappointing than expected.

Not as many people since the weather seemed a bit more iffy for corn

See the clouds over the summit, delaying corn o'clock

The smoooth consistent slope of the White Salmon Glacier. I felt like I started a bit too early on firm snow while going down.

As you can see there are quite a bit of rocks in the gully, and it's more lower angle than I wanted to have fun

But I wasn't early to the corn since I'd be skiing the south facing not-quite fall line slope of the gully (but not in the gully proper) - just had to veer right a couple of turns

Rocks spilling out at the bottom. My mistake was trying to traverse over this and its runnels to avoid having to skin back up, but really should have skied below this.

Bleh. Got close to taking my skis off at one point but eeked through.

## Notes
* This was probably ~15 miles and ~7700 feet of vertical gain.
* I don't think I'd ski this gully slope again, but would be open to descending the entire smooth slope of the WSG proper. But that slope looks to be less steep than the SW Chutes while having the same aspect, and why would you opt for a longer day for that. SW Chutes + AG Headwall just seems like the money move for a good day on the south side of Adams.
* For the AG Headwall line and this one in particular, I wonder if it's better to go more flat fall line down the Avalanche Glacier and then crossing below rather than going over the dirt ridge at 8400 feet. This would also avoid all rock runnels.
* For any south side Adams line, I'd be curious about camping at the lower Morrison Creek Campground to avoid the dirt road and parking situation at the upper Cold Springs area. Looks to be another 900 feet of vert in exchange for slightly more fall line skiing at the end instead of doing that dreaded skin back up.
* By now I don't think it matters if you take the South Climb or Suksdorf trail up, but I'd give the edge to the latter since you can avoid all steep/tricky sections.
