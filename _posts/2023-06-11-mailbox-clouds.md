Mailbox is an unremarkable peak for someone who's gotten used to the scenery around North Bend and the I-90 corridor, but was a great day for friends visiting from out east.
Ended up being a memorable one because it was one of those "above the clouds" type of days!

To me, this scenery is tedious but was noted as being quite cool and rainforest-y for my friend

I've had other days above the clouds but this one was particularly uniform

Back in the clouds now, very humid

## Notes
* This was probably ~5 miles and ~4000 feet of vertical gain.
