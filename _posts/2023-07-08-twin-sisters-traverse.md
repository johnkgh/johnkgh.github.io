Sometimes I feel like the Twin Sisters Range next to Mount Baker is often forgotten about.
The red tape with the logging company land ownership adds a bit to the weirdness and mystery.
Armed with mountain bikes, this turned into a great multi-sport adventure traversing from South Twin to North Twin.

This range is comprised of olivine rock, so sharp and grippy that it cut my hands and equipment up a little

Mount Baker is the only real view since this range is quite small

## Notes
* This was probably ~19 miles and ~7200 feet of vertical gain, 10 miles and 2000 feet of vert on the bike.
* We went from South to North but I imagine it goes both ways. Maybe the bike stashing is a little easier this way. The only thing that was techy was getting down the NE ridge of South Twin, which had some rockfall potential.
* You can take the whole ridge proper and not get cliffed out for South Twin, but that's not the case for North which has false summits and peaks.
* South also had bomber holds while North was a bit chossier.
