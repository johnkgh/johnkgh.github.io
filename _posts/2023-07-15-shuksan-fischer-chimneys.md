A fun scramble route on one of Washington's most iconic mountains.
Although I think of Mount Shuksan as more of a skier's mountain, I'll settle for scrambling on it when it's dry.

## Notes
* This was probably ~17 miles and ~7200 feet of vertical gain.
* Do not do this with a group of seven lol. Moving quickly will probably make for a better day.
* Lots of people rapping down the class 4 summit block and chimneys, so be wary as that might eat into your time. Honestly this route is a little over-trafficked so you'd need think about your tactics.
* I think inadvertently did most of the southeast ridge only because the main gully had a ton of parties going down and it's likely safer that way. There are lots of options to dial back the scrambling too.
