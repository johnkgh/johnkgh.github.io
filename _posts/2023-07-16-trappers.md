Tried to milk out the last of a weekend in the North Cascades after an exhausting day yesterday.

Trappers Peak is probably one of the easier ways to get eyes on the Pickets

Looking at the Snowfield Peak area and perhaps the Neve Glacier if it spills over onto this side; the Isolation Traverse exit side-ish

Now more at Eldorado, Austera, Klawatti area; the Inspiration Traverse side-ish

The classic hike from this trailhead usually goes to the lake, which I did 2 years ago, but now I'm thinking I should have climbed up instead to see the Pickets!
Maybe that would have inspired me a little more about this area.

## Notes
* This was probably ~10 miles and ~3400 feet of vertical gain.
