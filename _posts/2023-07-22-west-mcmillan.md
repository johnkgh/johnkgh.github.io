My first foray into the elusive Picket Range and perhaps one of the few peaks day-trippable in the area for my humble aerobic ambitions.

Hard to capture the scale in this picture, the drainage below is almost a 4500 foot drop over a very short distance, almost vertical at first. And probably a rare view of the Northern Pickets I imagine since it's hard to see from anywhere else!

West and East McMillan Spires

## Notes
* This was probably ~20 miles and ~10000 feet of vertical gain.
* Pick an unquestionably clear weather day next time!! Would be happy to repeat, maybe link up another peak.
