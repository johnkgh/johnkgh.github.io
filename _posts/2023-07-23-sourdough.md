I was originally going to note how unremarkable Sourdough Mountain is except for the fact that it casually rises almost 5000 feet from Diablo Lake below.
I guess I do take some of the easy peaks for granted sometimes - but I still think the views from the road are unimpressive compared to other national parks.

I guess I didn't technically go to Sourdough Mountain but the lookout instead

The wall of Colonial and Colonial + Neve glaciers to its right.
I need to check out this area more, all of these peaks kind of blend together.

Man I really need to find a good way to see Jack Mountain unobscured from across the lake - would love to see what 7500 feet of vertical relief from the base looks like.

## Notes
* This was probably ~10 miles and ~5100 feet of vertical gain.
