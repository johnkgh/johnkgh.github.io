This traverse covers the ridge of peaks directly south of Rainier from Stevens to Eagle Peak.
I don't think I'd recommend this one lol, mainly because it was a lot of work for views that didn't change all that much (although it was cool to see the angle of Rainier change a little bit going west to east).

Also starting above the clouds today. Hood very very faint in the back.

Now that's a mountain! Glad we did Stevens Peak first because it's far enough away from the other peaks where I would be very tempted to leave out if we went the other way.

A cramped shot of Rainier (14400 feet) and the Paradise Lot (5400 feet) below - a 9k difference!
Cool seeing the Nisqually Glacier flowing all the way down.

The last view from Eagle Peak.
All that work and it only looks to be a 35 angle difference in vantage point from Stevens Peak.
Rainier really is huge.

## Notes
* This was probably ~20 miles and ~10200 feet of vertical gain.
