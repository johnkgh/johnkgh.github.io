Up Sahale via the Quien Sabe Glacier route.
Waffled a bit due to the forecast but glad I made it out (although I regrettably stubbed my toe on a rock and broke it).

Cool looking rocks, but definitely chossy - the [AAC accident report](http://publications.americanalpineclub.org/articles/13200607400/Off-Route-Falling-Rock-Fall-on-RockRappel-Anchor-Failure-Inadequate-Protection-Washington-North-Cascades-National-Park-Sharkfin-Tower) was the only thing on my mind

## Notes
* This was probably ~12 miles and ~5700 feet of vertical gain.
* We did attempt to summit Boston, but the group wasn't feeling it due to how absolutely chossy it was. It wasn't too bad on the main trafficked path, but it felt like the mountain was falling apart if you veered slightly, and it's not a great feeling to think that a foothold is going to blow. Then scrambling up Boston is another question, but I hear it's good and I'd still like to give it a go.
