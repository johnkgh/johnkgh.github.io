My friend Haram ran the Teanaway 100, a pretty hard 100 mile ultramarathon here in Washington with around 30000 feet of gain, and did it with almost no training (no exaggeration).
And he managed to place 7th out of 23 at 32.5 hours, so a pretty decent performance.
His previous biggest day was running the Enchantments, a mere 18 miles with 5000 vert - pretty bonkers accomplishment if you work out the ratio of performance to time spent/effort invested.

No plot, no drama, and the Teanaway views never had much in store for me so not a lot of pictures from the event itself.
But Haram thought it'd be funny to go up Mailbox the next day, for the memes.
Definitely a weekend for the ages.

I forgot to mention this guy was _cooking_ on the way up.
I still couldn't keep up, insane.

## Notes
* This was probably ~5 miles and 4000 feet of vertical gain.
