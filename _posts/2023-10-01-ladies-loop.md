A nice group run to see some larches in the Chiwaukum Range.
I should come here more often.

My phone not doing any justice to the reds (although they were a bit late season), Grindstone in the back

This part of the run was kind of fun going through the old growth trees

## Notes
* This was probably ~20 miles and ~6000 feet of vertical gain.
* This does require some kind of bike/car shuttle unless you want to run 3 miles on dirt road.
