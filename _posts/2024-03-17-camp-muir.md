Not sure why I came up here since Camp Muir is a relatively uninteresting objective, but still good to check out the area.

Yea I can't lie, it's big and pretty.
So much more pretty coming here in the winter versus in the summer when the glaciers are all naked

## Notes
* This was probably ~13 miles and ~6900 feet of vertical gain, since I did two laps on the Muir Snowfield.
* I got started from the Paradise parking lot at 9:20 AM after waiting for the Longmire gate to open, so I think you need to be relatively quick to make it up to Camp Muir to time the corn o'clock correctly.
