A "Fifty Classic Ski Descent of North America" that I've been looking forward to for a long time!
This one was especially special since Chris and I crossed paths interning at some random company back in my hometown on the east coast.

Just two guys from Virginia eventually on a mountain in Washington together tackling a coveted line, how absurd the universe is sometimes.
I think often about the random trajectories and collisions of people's destinies, you can really never know where you'll end up and I guess that's the beauty of living sometimes.

Scoping out the top of the choke getting into the main couloir.
A bit of wind effect visible on the snow surface.
This turned out not to be a wind slab but windblown snow with minimal avalanche danger.

The bottom of the line is looking a little thin though.
I believe in most years this would be completely snow covered.

The sun setting even more as we finish scoping out the line

We were warned about an avalanche that ripped a couple days before we arrived for the weekend

What a weird place to be for two Virginians!

The obligatory boot out from the bottom of the drainage back into the ski area in weird snow

## Notes
* This was probably ~14 miles and ~8700 feet of vertical gain, since we did another lap on the White Salmon Glacier.
* The only thing I regret is not getting a binocular photo
* I might have to revisit this line in better conditions, hit some rocks at the bottom of the line, and the lower part of the White Salmon drainage was very thin (one of the worst years for low-elevation snowpack in Washington)
