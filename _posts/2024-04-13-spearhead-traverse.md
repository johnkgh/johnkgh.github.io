Need to come back and annotate this one later, but what a magical place.
I was a little worried coming into this with the historically bad lower-elevation snowpack, but it ended up not detracting from the experience at all.
Indeed, the conditions at Whistler resort were a little sad, but it was sooo white once you got up in the mountains proper.

## Notes

* This was probably ~28 miles and ~9800 feet of vertical gain from the top of Whistler Mountain to the base of Blackcomb.
