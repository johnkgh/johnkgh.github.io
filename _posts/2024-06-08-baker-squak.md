As straightforward of an up and down on Mount Baker as you can get.
Great to revisit this route, but man is it kind of a boring slog in the sense that the views don't change that much.
The conditions this weekend were a little uncertain to go for anything bigger and I needed the confidence booster after last week's debacle.

To the summit about 50 minutes faster than last time given my condition last week

## Notes
* This was probably ~14 miles and ~7400 feet of vertical gain.
