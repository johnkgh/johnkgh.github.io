I've done Ruth Mountain previously in the summer and I thought it had some of the best views in the North Cascades for the relatively easy level of effort.
I couldn't say no to the same views with even more snow, getting to Icy Peak this time, and skiing back down the slopes of Ruth.
Lots of repeat pictures on this one because the Shuksan ridge is so amazing to look at in person.

Man Shuksan goes quite low to the floor, it looks to be a 6000 foot drop to the riverbed

## Notes
* This was probably ~19 miles and ~8400 feet of vertical gain.
