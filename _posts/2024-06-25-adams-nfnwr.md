`NFNWR` is short for the north face of the northwest ridge on Mount Adams.
During the time I've been skiing in Washington, there's been some opinions that this line might be less and less skiable as climate change impacts the mountain.
With a fat high elevation snowpack and seeing that some friends skied this line, I knew it was time to pounce.

This is the choke that makes the line discontinuous most years.
The skiing through here was garbage loose poorly-edgeable snow.

I topped out at the pinnacle and abandoned the idea of going to the true summit after seeing how far away it was based on time constraints

Maybe I'll ski the glacier line a different time too

## Notes
* This was probably ~15 miles and 7300 feet of vertical gain.
