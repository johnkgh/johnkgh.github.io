The infamous hourglass climb which was quite chill and wasn't loose enough for me to kick any rocks down - the Cascades trained me well!
Although I quickly caught up to and got above another group that _did_ cause a ton of rockfall.
I think sticking on the vertical walls instead of in the gully probably minimizes the hazard.
Also don't know why people put fixed ropes here that are kind of sketchy to use ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è.

## Notes
* This was probably ~17 miles and ~7800 feet of vertical gain. I think I started around around 8300 feet, a few hundred feet below where most AWD vehicles make it up because\.\.\.
* This was probably the worst "road" I've attempted to drive and it's not even close. What you see in the last picture is the "road" that quickly turns into the "road"/"trail" in the pictures before it. I think the most tricked out vehicles and ATVs can make it all the way up to Lake Como at 11700 feet, but I honestly should have parked at end of the smooth dirt road at 8000 feet and walked from there. There is no incentive to improve this road and in fact, the cruelty is probably the point since the "road" is managed by some off-road association.
* The road situation really soured my experience, but the traverse itself wasn't too bad. Staying on the ridge proper is usually the best course of action. Nowhere near as bad as it waas hyped up online, which kind of confirms that the 14er content online reaches a different audience and that's totally okay!
