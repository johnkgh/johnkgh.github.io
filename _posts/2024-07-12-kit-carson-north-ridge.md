A fun scramble variation on what would normally be a slog of a route.
My first taste of bomber Crestone Conglomerate rock!

You can trace the arc that is the north ridge of Kit Carson Peak

Looking up at the ridge proper - very knobby and secure, great scrambling

There is a taller Mount Adams in Colorado! Just shy of 14000 feet.

## Notes
* This was probably ~14 miles and ~5500 feet of vertical gain.
* **This was the worst mosquito experience I've ever had and it's not even close.** I briefly opened my car door at the trailhead the night before and a ton of them flooded my car instantly, and I had to drive back on the main road to flush them out. I still had to kill about a dozen of them that night regardless. Barely stopped the entire day and the mosquitoes followed me to the base of the climb. I learned later that the Sangre de Cristo Mountains are notorious for mosquitos in the summer.
* There are a couple ways that people get to the north ridge proper but I went up the gully feature which is prone to rockfall and was probably the hardest slabby climb of the outing.
