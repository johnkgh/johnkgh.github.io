I've always wanted to do this ever since I saw the [Mediocre Amateur video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HYEOq3lKSlw) in what felt like another lifetime before the pandemic. I took the ridge direct, making it an extra long scramble ðŸ˜‹.

No idea what I'm looking at (Holy Cross Wilderness?), but I'm a sucker for sunrises nonetheless

Satan's Ridge connects Capitol to Snowmass, and is probably one of the dumber, dangerous, and chossiest things you can do in Colorado

## Notes
* This was probably ~17 miles and ~5800 feet of vertical gain. 500 of those feet was me trying to find my helmet that I dropped just before the ridge climb on the Mount Daly saddle that I thought rolled all the way to the bottom of the basin.
* Learned that camping at the Capitol Lake is quite common, but this doesn't seem like a crazy day and the mileage goes by pretty quickly.
* No surprises and less loose than expected. Knife edge was chill and the hardest climbing was probably getting up and down K2.
