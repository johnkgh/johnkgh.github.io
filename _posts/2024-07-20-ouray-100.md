The Ouray 100 probably ranks as one of the hardest ultramarathons in the country, clocking in at 102 miles, 42000 feet of vertical gain, at an average elevation of 10200 feet.

This was Haram's second hundred miler, and the second time he's run one with **almost no training**.
I'm actually not joking nor exaggerating, and this probably deserves its own piece of media or _something_.
He didn't do as well as he wanted due to getting sick, but credit where credit is due.

I have sooo many funny and fond moments that I captured throughout this event but mainly focusing on the beautiful scenery of the northern San Juan Mountains.

Quite dramatic mountains unlike anything else in this state.

What is going on with the geology of this place?
A fusion of the imposing peaks of the Canadian Rockies with some resemblance to the desert formations in neighboring Utah.

At least it was one of the most beautiful places to be tired in a race

After a quick nap, we booked it down to the finish line!

## Notes
* I collectively probably did a leisurely ~28 miles and ~11700 feet of vertical gain, only doing the easiest sections of the course over two days.
* Ouray/Ridgway is a beautiful town, with emphasis on great roadside views - definitely somewhere I'd take my parents. The food was surprisingly good as well.
* Race beta for next time:
  * Acclimating and training at elevation probably helped a lot.
  * Somehow bring the cold tub in the living quarters to boost immunity (broscience).
  * Dry shoes and socks are crucial so have backup pairs. We knew this on paper, but it wasn't a factor in the dry Teanaway 100 race last year, so we never truly internalized the importance of this.
  * Mash potatoes are still good, ramen slaps, and watermelon + banana works wonders.
  * Some vets apparently said to only get really good at the downhill, and walk everything else (including the flats) - this was the winner's strategy supposedly.
  * In a race as strenous as this, we could probably afford to spend more time at the aid stations resting and getting everything right.
  * Try not to roll any ankles. Ibuprofen and mylar blankets were useful.
  * Ridgway was very close to the race, about 15 minutes from Ouray, with great cell reception in both towns, which made things smooth.
