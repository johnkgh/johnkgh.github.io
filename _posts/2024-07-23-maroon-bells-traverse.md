An unexpectedly smokey day, but probably the best of the so called Great Fourtneer Traverses in Colorado.

Smokey views of Snowmass (left) and Capitol Peak (center).
Not gonna lie, seeing the smoke made kind of irked me, since I usually sit out if I can see/smell it.
I didn't notice in the dark before dawn but it became very apparent as I neared the summit of Maroon Peak.

Looking back to Maroon Peak from North Maroon.
This actually was the shortest of the traverses in terms of length and time.
There was some actual vertical and engaging climbing involved!

North Face of North Maroon - I would definitely consider skiing this if I had the opportunity

On Pyramid Peak looking south at the Pyramid family of peaks.
I ran out of water a while ago at this point and the smoke wasn't helping ðŸ˜….

On Pyramid Peak looking west at the Maroon Peaks, with snow still running down the Bell Cord Couloir center (also would love the opportunity to ski this).
Almost 4000 feet of vertical relief from the bottom, which is quite rare in Colorado!

Maroon Peaks from Maroon Lake

## Notes
* This was probably ~17 miles and ~8800 feet of vertical gain. ~4900 from the Maroon Bells Traverse and another ~3900 to Pyramid Peak.
* The Maroon Bells was nowhere near as chossy as people claimed.
* Had I paid attention, I could have climbed Pyramid much more smoothly lol. Unnecessarily ventured into loose class 4 terrain.
* Fill up on water before going up Pyramid because while there was plenty of snow, there was no running water anywhere on the trail.
