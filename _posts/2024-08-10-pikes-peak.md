Pretty unremarkable summit of Pikes Peak, although I think this 14er is over-hated.
I thought it was quite a nice walk (despite the cars).

No pictures below treeline, but you quickly start seeing cars along the road once you get to the flatter portion of the trail

Flat as a pancake summit. It is on my eventual bucket list to bike up and down this thing.

Touristy. The museum was kind of cool too (not shown).

Pikes Peak actually does have pretty impressive vertical relief, it's just that it's so boringly gradual.
It is a bit like the PNW volcanos in that it's so prominent and isolated that it serves as a visual anchor in certain parts of the state.

There is also a tram that goes to the top from Manitou Springs

Probably the only notable rock feature

## Notes:
* This was probably ~14 miles and ~4300 feet of vertical gain.
