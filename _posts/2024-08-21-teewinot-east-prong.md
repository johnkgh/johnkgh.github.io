Hesitating on the original plan to get up Mount Owen with the goal of scoping out the northern leg of the Grand Traverse.

<!--more-->

Tried for an attempt the previous day and got rained out not even before leaving treeline, and got discouraged by the flashes of lightning this morning so I slept in.
Definitely not trying to take any chances with the conditions since the critical downclimbs are shaded.

On East Prong looking at Mount Owen.
Ultimately I started too late in the day to now climb it and get back.
Not trying to downclimb 5.4 with time pressure or hike out in the dark.
Fortunately, I do believe _getting to_ the top of Owen is pretty straightforward (getting off Owen and to the Grandstand is the crux for most people supposedly).

Man I wish I got the view of the north face of the Grand from Mount Owen so I can see the full climbing route, but you can still make out the Italian Cracks and the many ledges

Unexpectedly annoying bushwack getting back to Delta Lake but mission accomplished!
The southeast ramp between Peak 11840 and East Prong was pretty chill and so I did not have to rap down the Koven Couloir climbing route.
I'm surprised this is not a more popular approach/deproach for Mount Owen.

## Notes
* This was probably ~11 miles and ~6700 feet of vertical gain. Maybe another 1200 feet of climbing to get to Owen and back.
* As noted earlier, this was to scope out the northern portion of the Grand Traverse that starts from Teewinot up the north ridge of the Grand Teton, and finishing with the Cloudveil Traverse.
* This can be broken up into the following sections (reminder to myself that I have a very detailed CalTopo map with my track + notes):
  * To Teewinot: Try to follow the trail and not get off route. There should be a reliable water source just below the red rocks near the top.
  * To Point 11840: Very easy hiking.
  * To East Prong: You can either rap down the west face of 11840 or downclimb the obvious NW couloir to the north. It is very chossy with a lot of overhead hazard though (although probably faster?). Then stay north of ridge proper on the way to East Prong and only get on the final ridge (which is kind of like a face climb).
  * To Owen (I didn't do this): Absolutely wait for dry conditions so you can contour around the north side of East Prong instead of rapping the west ridge. Fill up water here and climb up the rocky face show in the picture above, countour below the snow patches, then wrap around to the true summit of Owen.
* Onwards to the Grand Teton: ???
  * Downclimb Owen and make some raps to the col between Owen and the Grand (???).
  * Get to the Grandstand (???).
  * Climb the north ridge of the Grand Teton (Italian Cracks?) (???).
* [Gnarly crevasse fall incident on the Teton Glacier](https://www.thesharpendpodcast.com/episode-58) which made me hesitant to get anywhere near it.
