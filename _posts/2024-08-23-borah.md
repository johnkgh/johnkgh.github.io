Gotta tag the state high point while I'm here right?
If I ever want a taste of Colorado's Sangre de Cristo range, the Lost River Range is not terribly far.
The peaks are bigger too!

Another angle to Sacajawea Peak and Mount Idaho - that steepness!

Even the unnamed peaks look giant and interesting

## Notes
* This was probably ~8 miles and ~5300 feet of vertical gain.
* Try to stay on Chicken Out Ridge proper.
