A throwback and "free-solo" of my first alpine climb.

Still need to climb Ingalls Peak, which everyone does as their first alpine trad climb

The classic look back as you climb out of cruel Longs Pass

## Notes
* This was probably ~14 miles and ~7600 feet of vertical gain.
* I always go low and back up to Lake Ingalls since I think it's faster than countouring around below Fortune Peak.
* I've gone around the east and west side of Lake Ingalls and I don't think one is particularly better than the other, but I'll probably stick to east now out of familiarity.
* Same with staying on the true ridge vs going low to Stuart Pass. Don't think it matters much but I'll probably stay high.
* Stuart itself can be broken up into the following sections (and there is good beta online):
  * Mindless climb up white granite rocks and up to a ridge where you can spot Long John Tower at the top.
  * The climb down and back up a gully feature to the saddle just north of LJT.
    * There is a undercling bypass variation to the left that I did last time which I thought was a bit sketchy with a backpack. The gully keeps things chill (bit chimney-like).
  * From LJT, you can go high onto an airy ledge which I did last time, but countoured low this time and found the "tunnel" variation which I'd probably do again in the future since I think it's faster, don't have to gain unnecessary vert, and safer. It was pretty easy to spot with a sandy trail too.
  * Then you stay on some ledges until you climb up a south facing gully where the climbing begins on the west face of the summit.
  * The final climb portion of this route is rated 5.6. I had already climbed it before so I knew it was pretty ledge-y and secure, and I knew I could reverse all of the moves if necessary.
* I'm overexplaining the beta but this would be fun as a group solo next time.
