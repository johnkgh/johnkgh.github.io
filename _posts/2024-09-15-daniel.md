Been saving this one for those weird forecast days.
I don't give the Alpine Lakes Wilderness enough love - hoping to have more Plan A days here instead of relegating this area as a backup to "cooler" plans.
A bit more crowded, and the peaks are a bit smaller, but I overlook how comparably rugged it is compared to the North Cascades.

Mount Daniel's glaciers from afar look so tiny, but you remember how giant the crevasses are when you get up close!
And what Daniel doesn't have in height makes up for it in width.

## Notes
* This was probably ~16 miles and ~6300 feet of vertical gain since I tagged the other summits on the way to the true one.
* Try not to lose the trail to Peggys Pond since that's the last water source (there is a trail that goes low and bypasses it).
* When it's dry, it might be faster to take the route directly to the saddle below Mount Daniel's East Peak and retrace the route on the way back.
  * I took the ridge up, which I felt had unnecessary gain/scrambling.
  * Then I took the glacier route down which was also annoying because I had poor line of sight over the rock slabs.
