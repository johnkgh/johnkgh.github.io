A warmup before venturing deeper into the great Glacier Peak Wilderness.
I used to think the Entiats were a little lame and colorless, but revisiting the area was much cooler now that I could identify many peaks of the GPW/North Cascades and think fondly back to prior experience on those peaks.

## Notes
* This was probably ~14 miles and ~5600 feet of vertical gain.
* Make sure to go up the correct gully! We saw a couple people heading up the wrong way.
* We drove up to Phelps Creek Trailhead as they were regrading the dirt road, which was annoying to drive on the way up but pleasant on the way down. Looking forward to coming back to this area especially with the improved conditions.
