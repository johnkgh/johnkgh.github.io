A nice loop to tag two peaks while enjoying some fall colors.

A bit further away, but the classic sequence of Eldorado (center, snowcapped), Forbidden (pointy), Sahale/Boston (double summit), Buckner (furthest right) out back

With Helmet Butte in front - I imagine the views of GP from there are even better

Colors! I don't edit my photos, but my phone showing a fraction of the vibrancy I remember seeing in person.

And its 5000' of vertical relief over such a short distance up close

## Notes:
* This was probably ~23 miles and ~7900 feet of vertical gain.
* We decided to make it loop doing Chiwawa, going up the NE ridge of Fortress and dropping off the SW face.
  * Getting up to the NE ridge was annoyingly loose, but staying on the ridge proper and finding the class 4 chimney along the route was safer than staying in the gully (especially with other climbers going down).
  * And going back down the NE ridge would have been more tedious than the chill SW face, which is where all of the colors were anyways, along Helmet Butte. And loops > out-and-back all day!
