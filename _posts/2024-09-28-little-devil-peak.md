A scenic loop to see soak in the fall colors and perhaps the impetus/rebirth of this very website!

## Unsolicited Thoughts on This Website, Posting, and Social Media
Had a great conversation today about the eternal debate on the pros/cons of social media as it pertains to outdoor recreation.
To keep it short, and while a little-gatekeepy, I was thinking how an outing like this is worth keeping closer to the chest, even if this area is not necessarily unpopular (there is a trail after all).

There was something nice about going into this, having done no research, to explore unremarkable peaks in an unnoteworthy zone (at least on paper).
The spirit of exploration is not something I'm necessarily looking for in the outdoors (another point of contention), but it was nice to soak in this uncommon feeling that we usually squash as a side effect of consuming what's overshared.
Both sides are at fault for that one.

This is certainly not an original thought - it probably crosses the mind of anyone who uses Strava or Instagram.
But I never used to be this kind of person, the constant over-sharer.
I think the feeling of unease I get from social media is its paradigm of push notifications.
I really want to feel like I'm doing this for _me_ and not some sense of external validation.

But at the same time, I _do_ find value in sharing some of these outings, not as a "look how cool my life is!", but because there is something to gain from relating to common experiences or adding intrigue to something previously unknown.
I've certainly found value in reading others' blogs, watching YouTube videos with little views, and consuming lower-key media in general.

So I don't know, maybe it's the slower style of delivery that is resonating with me lately.
Right now this blog seems to be a happy medium of doing my own thing, while having a catalogue that people can look at, but also omitting a ton of detail and not publicizing too much, but this will be a topic I'll continue thinking a lot about.
