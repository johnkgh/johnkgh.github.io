Love seeing the jagged peaks of Washington Pass, but I'm not too good at identifying them currently

## Notes
* This was probably ~11 miles and ~5100 feet of vertical gain.
* We managed to park on the road pretty close to the trailhead, but parking can be veryyy bad this time of year. This trailhead gets hammered in particular.
