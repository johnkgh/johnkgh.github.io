Longer day than expected tagging these peaks, but all worth it to see prime larches!

Wow! People going to the usual larch spots near Ingalls or Maple Pass are missing out on the dense larch groves.

A victim of the Pioneer Fire this year. I was told by another hiker how beautiful it was here\.\.\.

Loved seeing the rim of larches as the sun was setting

## Notes
* This was probably ~21 miles and ~8500 feet of vertical gain.
* Pretty straightforward getting up Star and Courtney. Then follow the the sequence of undulating ridges to Oval.
* The only steep bit this entire day was the downclimb from the final ridge to climb back up the south ridge of Oval. You descend a NW gully and then get on the ridge proper, but I went a little too far down east of the ridge, which had a bit of holdless slab shenannigans.
* Getting down Oval to the lake on Oval Peak Trail is pretty easy, though the lake was very marshy and did not have drinkable water. Then the bushwack from the lake back to get back on the West Fork Buttermilk Trail was annoying but workable. I really think it's a choose your own adventure down.
