The previous day zapped more energy than expected, so I went for one of the supposedly easiest Bulgers.

Looking southwest towards the Reynolds Peak area.
The size of the burn zone is quite large, but there always seemed to be specks of larches throughout the top of ridges in this area.

## Notes
* This was probably ~11 miles and ~5200 feet of vertical gain.
* There is a trail up the whole thing, perfect bootskiing conditions down the scree.
