The Sawtooth Slam is a great way to knock out five easy mountains from the Bulger List.
The larches were a little past prime, but collectively they gave off a darker yellow hue that was noticeably different from the week prior.
Pretty cool to see the full lifecycle of these larches this season!

Hugging the edge of Cooney Lake. You really need unobscured morning light on water for better reflection views.

I was a bit bummed to see the larches thinning out, but it turns out it doesn't really matter when they are all bunched up.
As noted earlier, in great enough numbers, they give off a subdued yellow that's still just as cool to look at as when they were prime.

## Notes
* This was probably ~24 miles and ~9500 feet of vertical gain.
* Crater Creek Trailhead can get pretty crowded, or at least felt like it when we got back.
* We decided to go clockwise as we'd get the boring part of the way in the dark and make the descent back to the car much faster.
* Pretty straightforward overall but getting up Bigelow was a bit chossier than expected. Some parts of this outing was kind of like Wedge Mountain in British Columbia where you wouldn't expect boulders so big to be moving; must be something with the lichen or the unconsolidated dirt underneath.
* If there is a crux, it's probably the ridge on the way to Raven Ridge-Libby Peak from Hoodoo, where it was sometimes prudent to downclimb off the ridge or stay on the ridge proper, but the rock was insecure and flakey on the scrambly moves.
