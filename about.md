I'm a former flatlander based in Washington State who loves getting outdoors to see the beauty of nature, particularly in the American West.

This blog is a way for me to note those standout days that I want to remember and cherish.
I also find value in being able to share some of these experiences as an artifact independent of social media.
Treating this less of a resource/guide and more of a personal surface-level photo journal.

Continually a work in progress!
